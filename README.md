# BadUSB-Scripts
BadUSB Scripts I've Created. These are confirmed to work with flipper zero, but not a rubber ducky. 
Some of which might not currently complete the task as they are intended to. They are curently being worked on and will be updated once the main goal is closer to being achieved/or is achieved.
Everything here is for my learning expirence and will continue to do so. Nothing here is intended to be used for malicious intent. I do not hold any responsibity for what you do with any of the contents. As this is for my own learning, and to share what ive created. To help others learn and create in a Ethical way.  Feel free to reachout with suggestions/advice.
