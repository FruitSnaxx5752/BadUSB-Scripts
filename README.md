# BadUSB-Scripts
BadUSB Scripts I've Created. These are confirmed to work with flipper zero, but not a rubber ducky. 
Some of which might not currently complete the task as they are intended. They are curently being worked on and will be updated once the main goal is closer to being achieved/or is achieved.
Everything here is for my learning expirence and will continue to serve so for the forseeable future. Feel free to reachout with suggestions/advice.
